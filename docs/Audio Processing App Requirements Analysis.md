1. **Compressor Settings:**
   - Ratio: 4.00:1
   - Attack: 1.00 ms
   - Release: 30.0 ms
   - Threshold: 0.00 dB
   - Gain Reduction (GR): showing activity
   - Output: 29.8 dB
   - Makeup gain applied
   - Peak/RMS mode selection
   - Dry/Wet: 100%

2. **Limiter Settings:**
   - Gain: 0.00 dB
   - Ceiling: -0.30 dB
   - Lookahead: 3 ms
   - Release: 300 ms
   - Auto mode enabled

### Audio Configuration
From the second screenshot showing the ASIO driver configuration:

1. **Driver Setup:**
   - Using Generic Low Latency ASIO Driver
   - Sample Rate: 44100 Hz
   - Buffer Size: 441 Samples
   - Input Latency: 40.0 ms
   - Output Latency: 25.8 ms

2. **Virtual Audio Cable Setup:**
   - VB-Audio Virtual Cable is being used
   - Input: Jack Mic (Realtek Audio) - physical microphone
   - Output: CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable) - virtual output
   - This creates a virtual audio device that other software can record from

## Requirements Summary

The application needs to:
1. **Real-time audio processing** with low latency
2. **Boost/Gain control** for microphone input
3. **Compression** with configurable ratio, attack, release, and threshold
4. **Brick-wall limiting** with configurable ceiling and lookahead
5. **Virtual audio cable functionality** to route processed audio to other applications
6. **Cross-platform support** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
7. **Standalone operation** without requiring external DAW software




## Research Findings

  - Can be complex for simple applications
  - Larger learning curve

#### Alternative Libraries
- **PortAudio**: Cross-platform audio I/O library (C)
- **RtAudio**: Real-time audio I/O library (C++)
- **CLAM**: C++ Library for Audio and Music
- **STK**: Synthesis ToolKit in C++

### Virtual Audio Cable Solutions

#### Commercial Solutions
1. **VB-Audio Virtual Cable**
   - **License**: Donationware model
   - **Redistribution**: Allowed with conditions:
     - Must identify VB-CABLE as VB-Audio application
     - End users must be able to donate/pay license
     - Must mention origin (www.vb-cable.com)
     - Professional use requires volume licensing
   - **Limitations**: VB-CABLE A+B and C+D cannot be redistributed

2. **Virtual Audio Cable (VAC)**
   - Commercial product by Eugene Muzychenko
   - Professional licensing required for redistribution

#### Open Source Solutions
1. **Virtual Audio Wire (VAW)**
   - **Status**: Open source project (Windows only)
   - **Features**: Based on Microsoft MSVAD sample
   - **Limitations**: 
     - Windows-only
     - Requires driver-level programming
     - Project appears inactive (last update 12 years ago)

2. **BlackHole (macOS)**
   - Modern macOS virtual audio loopback driver
   - Zero additional latency
   - Open source

3. **JACK Audio Connection Kit**
   - Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
   - Professional audio routing
   - Real-time, low-latency
   - Open source

### Audio Processing Algorithms

#### Compression Algorithm
- **Purpose**: Reduce dynamic range by attenuating signals above threshold
- **Key Parameters**:
  - Ratio (e.g., 4:1)
  - Threshold (trigger level)
  - Attack time (how quickly compression starts)
  - Release time (how quickly compression stops)
  - Makeup gain (compensate for level reduction)

#### Brick-Wall Limiter Algorithm
- **Purpose**: Prevent signal from exceeding specified ceiling
- **Key Components**:
  - **Lookahead**: Delay input signal to anticipate peaks
  - **Peak Detection**: Identify samples that would exceed ceiling
  - **Gain Reduction**: Calculate required attenuation
  - **Smoothing**: Apply smooth gain changes to avoid distortion
  - **Release Curve**: Exponential return to unity gain

#### Implementation Approach (from Signalsmith Audio)
1. **Peak-Hold**: Moving minimum to track required gain reduction
2. **Smoothing**: FIR filter to smooth gain changes
3. **Delay**: Compensate for lookahead processing
4. **Release**: Exponential curve for natural sound

### Technical Requirements Summary

#### Core Audio Processing
- Real-time processing with low latency (<50ms total)
- Sample rates: 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz
- Bit depths: 16-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit float

- Route processed audio to virtual output
- Allow other applications to record from virtual device

#### Cross-Platform Considerations
- **Windows**: ASIO, WASAPI, DirectSound support
- **macOS**: Core Audio integration
- **Linux**: ALSA, PulseAudio, JACK support

#### Performance Requirements
- Buffer sizes: 64-512 samples
